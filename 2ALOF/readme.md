### A Gene-Based Recessive Diplotype Exome Scan Discovers FGF6 as a Novel Iron Metabolism Gene
#### 1. Determination of Putative Functional Variants
Putative functional variants included in the analyses satisfied the quality control criteria as described previously.37 In addition, markers in the analyses were either GWAS-significant as of June 2015 and/or annotated as missense, nonsense, 3’UTR, 5’UTR or occurring within a splice site region.
#### 2. Haplotype Phasing
In general, gametic phasing is necessary to directly determine compound heterozygous individuals at a particular gene.  Several algorithms are available for inferring phased haplotypes from unphased genotype data using population-based samples, including the localized haplotype-cluster model algorithm implemented in the software Beagle.40 Each gene in the exome was phased separately using this method within Beagle.
