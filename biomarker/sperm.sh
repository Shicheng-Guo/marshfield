# We also downloaded whole-genome DNA methylation data at single-base resolution from mature human mature sperm cells 
# (BCMsample25783, BCMsample25784, and Molaro_pooled) from the Bioinformatics Research Laboratory, Baylor College of 
# Medicine website [http://genboree.org/EdaccData/Genomic_Human_Germline_Hypomethylation/Sperm_Bisulfite-Seq_Data/] [27,28]. 
# For the mature human sperm cell samples, the average of DNA methylation levels on all CpG sites in a CGI was calculated as
# DNA methylation level on the CGI.
# GRCH38
